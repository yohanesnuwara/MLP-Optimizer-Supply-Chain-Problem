# Supply Chain Optimization using MLP Optimizers

Inspired by the hackathon organized by Shell and recent discussion in LinkedIn, I am sharing my experiment of "hacking" MLP (multi-layer perceptron) optimizers such as from Tensorflow Keras framework to solve a discrete optimization problem for supply chain fleet management. It is widely believed that MLP optimizers only works for continous problem, but I managed to get it work for discrete problem and give quite satisfactory result. 

The implementation is written in Keras. Data and notebook can be found in this repo.
